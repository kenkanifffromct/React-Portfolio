              News, VA for all 26 years of my life; but I hope to live a more
              rural life, starting in the near future. If I'm not at work
              maintaining handtool and vending stock for Huntington Ingles, then
              I'm either cooking at home, spending money at Lidl or
              participating at church.</p>
                <p>I'm currently a student in the coding bootcamp at the University
              of Richmond and will graduate in May 2021. As recent as 8 months
              ago, I would've never thought I'd make a career of coding. It
              makes sense though because I love building things, although the
              things I'm used to building are more physical (like wood
              furniture) than digital (like a website). This will simply utilize
              my passion for building things in a new format.</p>
